# LiveSpecs as an AMD module
This is an example project that shows how to use LiveSpecs to document and test your JS code.

The code we'll be testing is [calc.js](https://github.com/alexishevia/LiveSpecs/blob/master/examples/global_variables/calc.js), a very basic calculator library.

## How to run
Start a local server and open the file [docs/index.html](https://github.com/alexishevia/LiveSpecs/blob/master/examples/amd/docs/index.html).

Click on the 'Try it out!' buttons to see the test output. You can also modify the code and click 'Try it out!' to see how the library would behave with different inputs.
