# LiveSpecs
Front end testing using live sample code

LiveSpecs is based on 3 ideas:
- Every project needs good documentation and test coverage
- Documentation should never go out of date
- Code examples are the best type of documentation

With LiveSpecs you can write code examples that can be displayed on your documentation site, but also run as part of your test suite.
